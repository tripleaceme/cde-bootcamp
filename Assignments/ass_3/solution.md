### Mapping Out Necessary Entities and Relationships:

Develop a data model that includes the key entities (e.g., customer, branch, menu items, sales, payments) and the relationships between them.

## Creating a Dimensional Model:

- Business Process: Sales Analysis

- Business Questions:
  - What are the sales trends across different branches and payment methods?
  - How do dining options (dine-in, take-out, online) affect sales?
  - What menu items are performing well in which locations?
- Grain: Each transaction (sale).
- Dimensions:
  - Location (branch)
  - Time (date, time)
  - Payment Method (cash, card, online gateway)
  - Dining Option (dine-in, take-out, online)
  - Menu Item (specific items sold)
- Fact: Sales (transactional data including amount, quantity, and total sales).
